# We Love Penguins

We Love Penguins is a site for a fictional conservation society that provides the oppurtunity for people to find out more about the work being done to protect penguins from climate change related threats, and to become more involved in this work. We Love Penguins provides some facts about the three main species of penguins that inhabit Antarctica, and an explanation of how climate change affects them.

The site can be accessed [here](https://bezabu.github.io/bb-penguin/)
