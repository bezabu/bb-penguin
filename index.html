            <p>
                Depending on who you ask, there are between 17 and 20 living species of penguin, ranging from the Little
                penguin, which can grow up to 33cm and is found in Australia and New Zealand, to the tallest and
                heaviest Emperor penguin which inhabits the coldest reaches of Antarctica.

            <h2>Where are the penguins?</h2>
            <p>
                Penguins are native to the southern hemisphere, but they are not limited to Antarctica. Some species may
                be found as far north as Angola, Argentina, Australia and even the Galápagos Islands.

            <h2>What are Emperor penguins?</h2>
            <p>
                The Emperor Penguin is the tallest and heaviest of the penguins. They reach around 115cm in height and
                weigh up to 45kg. Apart from their size, the easiest way to tell Emperor penguins from the similar
                looking King penguins is the colour of
                their ear patches. In emperor penguins the feathers are white with a hint of orange which fades to black
                along the back of the head, whereas in king penguins the feathers are orange and contained in a little
                circle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emperor penguin's diet primarily consists of fish but also includes crustaceans, such as krill,
                and cephalapods such as
                squid. The lifespan of a typical emperor penguin is 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest
                that some individuals
                may live to 50 years of age.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emperor colonies are only found in the Antarctic, where they breed on frozen sea ice. Because of this
                they may never set foot on land. Males are left in charge of the egg, keeping it warm in it's brood
                pouch (a warm pouch of skin) while balancing it on top of his feet. He does this for around 70 days
                while the
                mother looks for food.

            <h2>What's happening to the penguins?</h2>
            <p>
                Thanks to the effects of climate change and industrial overfishing, the majority of penguin species have
                declining
                populations. The IUCN classifies 5 species of penguin as vulnerable and 5 species as endangered.
                There 5 species of penguin on the endangered list include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Northern Rockhopper Penguin</li>
                <li>Erect-Crested Penguin</li>
                <li>Yellow-Eyed Penguin</li>
                <li>African Penguin</li>
                <li>Galápagos Penguin</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In 2012 the largest and most well known species of penguin, the Emperor Penguin was uplisted from a
                species
                of least
                concern to near threatened by the IUCN.
