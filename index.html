            <p>
                Depending on who you ask, there are between 17 and 20 living species of penguin, ranging from the Little
                penguin, which can grow up to 33cm and is found in Australia and New Zealand, to the tallest and
                heaviest Emperor penguin which inhabits the coldest reaches of Antarctica.

                <li>Little penguins (Australian Little penguin, Little Blue penguin)</li>
                <li>Banded penguins (Magellanic penguin, Humboldt penguin, Galápagos penguin, African penguin)</li>
                <li>Megadyptes (Yellow-eyed penguin, Waitaha penguin)</li>
                <li>Crested penguins (Fiordland penguin, Snares penguin, Erect-crested penguin, southern and northern
                    rockhopper penguins, Royal penguin, Macaroni penguin)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Where are the penguins?</h2>
            <p>
                Penguins are native to the southern hemisphere, but they are not limited to Antarctica. Some species may
                be found as far north as Angola, Argentina, Australia and even the Galápagos Islands. Generally, the
                larger species are found in Antarctica while the smaller species live further north in warmer climates.

            </p>
            <p>
                Penguins are flightless birds, although they swim so well that below the surface of the water they look
                like birds in
                flight. Penguins tend to hunt for food in the cold waters surrounding Antarctica and breed on land (or
                ice).
                Gentoo penguins are the fastest swimmers, capable of reaching speeds of up to 36km (22 miles) per hour
                while searching for food or evading predators.

            <h2>What are Emperor penguins?</h2>
            <p>
                The Emperor Penguin is the tallest and heaviest of the penguins. They reach around 115cm in height and
                weigh up to 45kg. Apart from their size, the easiest way to tell Emperor penguins from the similar
                looking King penguins is the colour of
                their ear patches. In emperor penguins the feathers are white with a hint of orange which fades to black
                along the back of the head, whereas in king penguins the feathers are orange and contained in a little
                circle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emperor penguin's diet primarily consists of fish but also includes crustaceans, such as krill,
                and cephalapods such as
                squid. The lifespan of a typical emperor penguin is 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest
                that some individuals
                may live to 50 years of age.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emperor colonies are only found in the Antarctic, where they breed on frozen sea ice. Because of this
                they may never set foot on land. Males are left in charge of the egg, keeping it warm in it's brood
                pouch (a warm pouch of skin) while balancing it on top of his feet. He does this for around 70 days
                while the
                mother looks for food.

            </p>
            <h2>What are Adélie penguins?</h2>
            <p>
                Adélie penguins sport a characteristic black and white ‘tuxedo’ look, with white rings around their
                eyes. Male and female Adélie penguins look very similar which can make it hard to distinguish them.
                They are only found along the coast of the Antarctic continent. They are the most widespread penguin
                species and is the most southerly distributed, along with the Emperor penguin.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Adélie penguin was named by the French Antarctic explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville, who named them
                after his wife
                Adéle.
                They were noted by early explorers to be quite curious and unafraid of humans and their dogs. They have
                also been known to take on predators such as seals or large seabirds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Males attempt to attract potential mates by building the biggest and best nests out of small rocks and
                stones. Sometimes
                unscrupulous males will steal building materials from neighbouring nests.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adélie penguins are impressive swimmers, they need to be to escape from Leopard Seals.
                Adélie penguins feed mainly on krill, but scientists now believe that this is a fairly recent preference
                following the
                decline of the Antarctic Fur Seal and Baleen Whales, both of which also feed on krill.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite this, krill populations are under threat from overfishing by humans and climate change threatens
                the loss of
                Antarctic ice sheets where they breed.

                Thanks to the effects of climate change and industrial overfishing, the majority of penguin species have
                declining populations. The IUCN classifies 5 species of penguin as vulnerable and 5 species as
                endangered.
                There 5 species of penguin on the endangered list:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Northern Rockhopper Penguin</li>
                <li>Erect-Crested Penguin</li>
                <li>Yellow-Eyed Penguin</li>
                <li>African Penguin</li>
                <li>Galápagos Penguin</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In 2012 the largest and most well known species of penguin, the Emperor Penguin was uplisted from a
                species of least concern to near threatened by the IUCN.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to NASA, Antarctica is losing ice mass at an average rate of <em>150 billion tons</em> per
                year. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet in particular has warmed by 2.4°C since 1958. Emperor and Adélie
                penguins depend on sea ice for their main food source.
